`[t002]`'s sweep tested `constant_revisit` at `revisit_prob ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3}` and the r-curve was monotonically increasing through the upper bound — meaning P5 ("optimal r is a function of uncertainty, not a constant") could not be evaluated. Either the optimum lies above r=0.3 or there is no optimum within sensible bounds. Extend the axis to e.g. `{0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9}`, re-run a focused sweep (no need to repeat the existing rows — append new r values for the existing seeds), and update the interpretation with the resolved finding. Specifically: does the optimum vary with `bias_model` × `noise_level` (P5 supported) or land at a single r across all conditions (P5 disconfirmed in the simpler form)?

Lightweight enough to keep within the existing `RUNTIME_BUDGET_SECONDS = 3180s` budget if scoped only to the new r values; re-anchor the gate if the full grid is re-run. Deliverable: an updated interpretation section addressing P5 specifically, with a figure showing the full r-curve.
