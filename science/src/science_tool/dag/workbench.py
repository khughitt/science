"""Pydantic v2 schema for ``<patch>.workbench.yaml`` files (Task 5a).

A workbench file is the editable normalized projection an author edits.
``compile`` (Task 5b) turns rows into PropositionEntity + EvidenceLineEntity
records in the knowledge graph.

Structural contract
-------------------
- ``WorkbenchRow`` is an *input-only* projection — it carries only authored
  fields.  Post-compile derived/aggregated fields (``edge_status``, ``belief``,
  ``posterior``, ``support``/``dispute`` arrays, ``massed_support``) are
  **not** allowed here.  ``model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")`` enforces
  the allowlist: any unlisted key (including every forbidden key) raises
  ``ValidationError``.
- ``EvidenceStub`` allows an optional ``quantitative_result`` *inside* the
  stub.  Placing ``quantitative_result`` at row level is forbidden by the same
  extra="forbid" rule.
- ``WorkbenchFile`` wraps ``rows: list[WorkbenchRow]`` with a minimal header.
