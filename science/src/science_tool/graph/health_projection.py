"""Health-report projection: section classification and severity thresholding.

Lives beside health rather than in ``budget/`` so the budgeting mechanism stays free of
domain knowledge.

The classification was verified against the TypedDicts on 2026-07-24 and getting it wrong
is not cosmetic: treating ``cross_paper_evidence`` as a ``counts_as_issue`` section hides
its errors entirely, because it has no such field.

``counts_as_issue`` is ISSUE-COUNT MEMBERSHIP, not severity. It decides whether a row
feeds ``count_issues`` and is never used to filter display -- the two are orthogonal, and
``prose_epistemics`` emits ``severity: "warning"`` together with ``counts_as_issue: True``.
