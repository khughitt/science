# Research a Topic

Write a structured background synthesis on the topic specified by `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Setup

Follow `references/command-preamble.md` (role: `research-assistant`).

Additionally:
1. Read `templates/background-topic.md`.
2. Check `doc/topics/` for existing coverage; ask before overwriting.
3. Check `doc/papers/` for relevant summaries.

## Research Process

1. Start from LLM knowledge and draft core concepts, active debates, and project relevance.
2. Use web search to verify key references and capture recent changes.
3. Do not read PDFs unless user provides a file path.

## Writing

Follow `templates/background-topic.md` and fill all sections.
Save to `doc/topics/<topic-slug>.md`.

The output should include:

- Key subtopics and how they connect.
- What is well-established vs uncertain.
- Links to existing hypotheses and open questions.
- Suggested follow-up research tasks.

If loaded aspects contribute additional sections (e.g., Tooling & Implementation from `software-development`), include them after the core sections.

## After Writing

1. Add new references to `papers/references.bib` (create with header if missing).
2. Add newly surfaced questions to `doc/questions/` using `templates/question.md`.
3. Offer to create follow-up tasks via `science-tool tasks add` derived from the synthesis.
4. Commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "doc: research topic <topic>"`

## Process Reflection

Reflect on the **background-topic template** sections and the **source hierarchy** guidance.

After completing the task above, append a brief entry to `doc/meta/skill-feedback.md` (create the file and directory if they don't exist).

Use this format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — research-topic

**Template/structure friction:**
- Any section you left empty, filled with boilerplate, or that felt forced

**Missing capture:**
- Information you wanted to record but had no natural place for

**Guidance issues:**
- Command instructions that were confusing, contradictory, or didn't help

**What worked well:**
- A section or instruction that genuinely improved the output
```

Guidelines:
- Be concrete and specific, not generic ("the Controversies section felt redundant for a well-established topic" > "some sections could be improved")
- 2-5 bullets total. Skip categories that have nothing to report.
- If everything worked smoothly, a single "No friction encountered" is fine — don't manufacture feedback
