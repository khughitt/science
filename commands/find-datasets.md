# Find Datasets

Find datasets for `$ARGUMENTS`.
If no argument is provided, derive candidate search terms from `specs/research-question.md`, active hypotheses, and inquiry variables, then ask the user to confirm the focus.

## Setup

Follow `references/command-preamble.md` (role: `research-assistant`).

Additionally:
1. Read `skills/data/SKILL.md` for data management conventions.
2. If present, read `skills/data/frictionless.md` for Data Package guidance.
3. Read `templates/dataset.md` for dataset documentation format.
4. Read project context:
   - `specs/research-question.md`
   - `specs/scope-boundaries.md`
   - `specs/hypotheses/`
   - Existing `doc/datasets/` (to avoid duplicating known datasets)
5. If an inquiry exists, check inquiry variables to understand what data the project needs:
   ```bash
   science-tool inquiry list --format json
   ```

## Tool invocation

All `science-tool` commands below use this pattern:

```bash
uv run science-tool <command>
```

For brevity, the examples below write just `science-tool <command>` — **always expand to `uv run science-tool <command>` when executing. See command-preamble step 8 for fallback.**

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify data needs

Based on project context:
- What variables does the project need data for?
- What modalities are relevant? (genomics, clinical, survey, imaging, etc.)
- What organisms or populations?
- What access constraints apply? (must be public, specific licenses, etc.)
- What formats are preferred?

Summarize needs concisely before searching.

### Step 2: LLM candidate generation

Using your knowledge of available datasets in the field:
- Suggest 5-10 candidate datasets with rationale
- Include known accessions, DOIs, or repository names where possible
- Explain why each is relevant to the project

### Step 3: Adapter-driven search

Use `science-tool datasets search` to find datasets across repositories:

```bash
# Broad search across all sources
science-tool datasets search "<query>" --format json

# Targeted search on specific sources
science-tool datasets search "<query>" --source zenodo,geo --format json
```

For each promising result, get full metadata:

```bash
science-tool datasets metadata <source>:<id> --format json
```

And list available files:

```bash
science-tool datasets files <source>:<id> --format json
```

Cross-reference LLM suggestions with search results. Note which candidates were verified and which remain unverified.

### Step 4: Rank candidates

Rank by:
1. **Relevance** — covers project variables, matches research question
2. **Quality** — sample size, known provenance, peer-reviewed origin
3. **Accessibility** — public access, permissive license, standard format
4. **Completeness** — covers multiple needed variables, adequate sample size
5. **Recency** — newer datasets may have better methods/standards

Label each as:
- `Use now` — download and integrate immediately
- `Evaluate next` — promising but needs closer inspection
- `Track` — potentially useful, defer

### Step 5: Document selected datasets

For each `Use now` or `Evaluate next` dataset, create a dataset note:

**File:** `doc/datasets/data-<slug>.md` using `templates/dataset.md`

Fill in all available fields. For fields you cannot verify, mark as `[UNVERIFIED]`.

### Step 6: Variable mapping (if inquiry exists)

If the project has an active inquiry, create a coverage matrix:
- List each inquiry variable
- Map which dataset(s) provide data for it
- Flag unmapped variables (data gaps)
- Flag variables with multiple dataset sources (potential for cross-validation)

Include this mapping in a `## Variable Coverage` section of the search output.

### Step 7: Update project files

1. Update `science.yaml` data_sources section with new entries.
2. Write machine-readable search results to `doc/searches/YYYY-MM-DD-datasets-<slug>.json`.
3. If appropriate, suggest download commands:
   ```bash
   science-tool datasets download <source>:<id> --dest data/raw/
   ```
4. Offer to create follow-up tasks via `science-tool tasks add`:
   - Download and inspect `Use now` datasets
   - Create `datapackage.json` for downloaded data
   - Map variables for pipeline planning

### Step 8: Suggest next steps

1. Download selected datasets
2. Create Frictionless Data Package descriptors
3. Run `/science:plan-pipeline` to build computational workflow
4. Run `/science:discuss` to evaluate dataset choices

## Output Summary

Present a concise summary table:

| Dataset | Source | Accession/DOI | Tier | Key Variables | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Followed by any data gaps that need to be addressed.

## Process Reflection

Reflect on the **template** and **workflow** used above.

If you have feedback (friction, gaps, suggestions, or things that worked well),
report each item via:

```bash
science-tool feedback add \
  --target "command:find-datasets" \
  --category <friction|gap|guidance|suggestion|positive> \
  --summary "<one-line summary>" \
  --detail "<optional prose>"
```

Guidelines:
- One entry per distinct issue (not one big dump)
- If the same issue has occurred before, the tool will detect it and
  increment recurrence automatically
- Skip if everything worked smoothly — no feedback is valid feedback
- For template-specific issues, use `--target "template:<name>"` instead
